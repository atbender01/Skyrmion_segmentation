SimLTEM
=======
These two modules, along with ``microscopes`` from :ref:`PyTIE<PyTIEapi>`, calculate the electron phase shift through a given magnetization and simulate the LTEM images. 

- ``comp_phase`` contains the linear superposition method and Mansuripur algorithm for calculating the electron phase shift. 
- ``sim_helper`` has loading, display, and setup functions.
